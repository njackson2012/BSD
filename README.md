## Welcome to my sharable work!


  My aim for this repo is to be an accissble hub for code and projects I can share, but are not easily sent over email.

### Contents
 - **AlphaPackage:** A collection of instructions and scripts required to connect a custom motion platform to Unity.
 
#### AlphaPackage
  I got a chance to work with an engineering club on Drexel's campus. They were trying to build their own motion simulation platform and they needed a programmer to connect Unity to an electrical component interface called SimTools. The contents of the zipped package are what I was able to send to them.
